"""mysite URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.urls import include, path
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  path('blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

# final urls or endpoints come here.
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('todolist.urls')),
    path('accounts/', include('accounts.urls')),
]

# The include() function allows referencing other URLconfs. 
# Whenever Django encounters include(), it chops off whatever 
# part of the URL matched up to that point and sends the remaining 
# string to the included URLconf for further processing.
# The idea behind include() is to make it easy to plug-and-play URLs. 
# Since polls are in their own URLconf (polls/urls.py), 
# they can be placed under “/polls/”, or under “/fun_polls/”, 
# or under “/content/polls/”, or any other path root, and the app will still work.
